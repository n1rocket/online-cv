    summary: |
      Since I was a child my passion was technology, I am restless and I like to investigate. I love to feel that programming is an art, since it allows me to enjoy my work and want to continue being a better professional every day.
      I love to work in a team because people usually contribute their vision of things and I like to be open-minded to accept criticism and new knowledge.
